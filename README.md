[d]: #project

Stigma is fast and powerful dynamic JavaScript schema validator. It can be used in Node.js and in all modern browsers.
<br> Results of testing in old browsers haven't been established yet. 

# THE PROBLEM
Is is hard to keep your data consistent throughout a project.
<br>You need to routinely check it to make it sure it didn't get wrong during runtime while user types in.
<br>If we do it manually by ``if/then`` statements at some point it is becomes messy very quickly.
<br>The Stigma simplifies this way allowing us to specify the schema that would 
<br>validate data against every time it gets changed so that solving the problem easily.

<br>Imagine user have made a mistake inside the mail field and then we get this data model:
```typescript
  import {SchemaMixed, Stigma} from './stigma'
  let user = {
        name  : 'Jake'
      , friend: 'Finn'
      , email : 'JakeTheDog$example.com'
  }
```
Did you spot that mistake out there? Let's see how we could handle this case by Stigma validator and detect the error.
<br>At first, we cast our schema which is just the shape of our object:
```typescript
  let userSchema: SchemaMixed<typeof user> = {
       name     :  String
      ,friend   :  function (value){ value == 'Finn' ?  null : 'Finn the only best friend!'}
      ,email    : [String,(value, key) => value.includes('@') ? null : 'Invalid email! ']
  }
```

Now creating our user validator and validate it:
```typescript
  let validator = new Stigma(userSchema)
  let error     = validator.validateOf(user) // => Invalid email!
```
To see whole example follow [here](/example.ts)

## GETTING STARTED
[gt]: #getting-started 'Getting started guide'
### REQUIREMENTS
[rq]: #requirements
Before you start make sure you have NodeJS installed and available in your global ``PATH`` variable.

### INSTALLATION
[i]: #installation 'Installation guide' 

```shell
$ cd your/project/path
$ npm i hinell/stigma -S
```
## USAGE
[u]: #usage 'Product usage'

```typescript
  let dataStructure = {_id: ..., description: 'Something firing up....'}
  let schema        = {_id: ..., description: String } // String here is a rule for checking
  let validator     = new Stigma(schema)
  let error         = validator.validateOf(dataStructure)
```
### Exampe of adding new validator
Let's assume we want to add ``_id`` field validation, but how we do this?
<br>Just let's flavour our schema. Add one function that checks ID class and returns a string message that would be an error later:
```typescript
  let schema        = {_id (value){
    return (value instanceof SomeIDClass) ? null : 'IDClass instance expected!'
  }}
  let validator     = new Stigma(schema)
      validator.validateOf(dataScturcture,function (error){
        if(error) ... 
        ok(dataScturcture)
      })
```


## API
[a]: #api 'Module\'s API description'
#### WARNING!: This api is subject to change! Make sure you know what you're doing!

```typescript
let schema    = {key: String}; 
let somedata  = {key: 'keyvalue'};
let validator = new Stigma(schema);
let error     = validator.validateOf(someObject);
                validator.validateOf(error => ... )
```
Where ``String`` in the ``{key: String}`` is called a Rule. Possible rules are the following:
```typescript
function(value, field): String | Error
Function | Number| String| Boolean| Array| Date
```

The latest are considered a special ``'words'`` for every of which Stigma keeps special validator. 
<br>Check out the [Stigma](./src/stigma.ts#L1) source code for more details.

### CHANGES
### Since API 1.0
#### Schema: Rules ('string','number' etc.)
Rules like ``'string'``, ``'number'`` or ``'array'`` now are legacy and would be deprecated in the near future.
<br>You'll be warned if you are using them.
<br>Use ``String``, ``Number`` or ``Array`` instead like proposed above.

## STIGMA EXPLAINED
[e]: #stigma-explained
The main idea behind this module is to address the need of checking the validity of some ``data``
<br>structure (key-value storage) by means of schema ``validation``.
<br>The ``schema`` is just a shape (JSON or just JS object) which we *cast* out from existing data instance
<br>by specifying each key with type checker 
<br>(there are several built-in that can be called in by passing js constructor name like ``Number``)
<br>corresponding to keys of ``data`` instance.
<br>Then using validator created by **Stigma** from casted schemas we can validate our data
<br>relieving us from difficulties with type and value checking.
