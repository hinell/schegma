> Declarative JavaScript and TypeScript js object schema validation tool.

```typescript
new Rules({
    name      : [String, min(4)]
  , password  : [String, min(6)]
  , email     : [String, (string) => /@/g.test(string) || '@ is missing!' ]
  , biography : ['optional', String, min(32), max(512)]
  , birthDate : ['optional', Date]
  , code      : ['optional', Number]
}).validate({
    name      : 'RagnarÃ¶k'
  , password  : '12345qwerty'
  , email     : 'what?'
},true); // => '@ is missing!'

```

### ALTERNATIVES
**Q:** Why don't to use joi or any other schema-validation library instead?
<br>**A:** Well the reason of this is that some of these libraries
<br>are too complicated and time-expensive to learn for me.
<br>The Stigma was created as ad-hoc solution and isn't intended 
<br>to be replacement for any of these useful librariess.
<br>You are free to choose any.
